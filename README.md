## EXPERIMENT 2: NUMERICAL PYTHON (NUMPY)

### Introduction
In this experiment, we explore the Numpy library and its powerful array manipulation functions. The focus is on solving mathematical problems efficiently using Python. We will generate and manipulate arrays,   apply statistical functions, and practice saving and loading data with Numpy.

**Objectives**
- Exploring Numpy functions.
- Applying Numpy in Python to perform computations.
  
### Software Used
- Jupyter Notebook
- Numpy library
  
### Problem 1: Normalization
- Generate a random 5x5 ndarray (X).
- Normalize X using the z-score formula: Z = (X - mean) / std.
- Save the result as X_normalized.npy.

### Problem 2: Divisible by 3
- Create a 10x10 ndarray of squares of the first 100 integers.
- Extract elements divisible by 3.
- Save the result as div_by_3.npy.
  
### Troubleshooting
- File Not Found: Make sure the files X_normalized.npy and div_by_3.npy are saved in the correct location.
- Import Errors: Ensure Numpy is installed with pip install numpy.
- Shape Mismatch: Check that the arrays have the right shape for operations.
